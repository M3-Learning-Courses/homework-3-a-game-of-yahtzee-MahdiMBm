## Comments:

Your code had all of the key components and the hold dice worked. The scoring did not function as well as I would like, but the addition of an interactive graphical interface was a very nice touch -- I gave you bonus points for that. There were some functions like ending the turn and game early which were not implemented as they should have been. You made one big mistake by not including any unit tests. I graded easy generally for this but you did not include any for the code that you wrote.
